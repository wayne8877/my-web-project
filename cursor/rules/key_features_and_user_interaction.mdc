## Key Interactive Elements to Emphasize / Develop
-   **Language Toggle (`languageToggle` button):**
    -   Functionality: Switches website content between Chinese and English (uses `translations.js` and `language.js`).
    -   User Experience: Clear visual indication of the current language and easy switching.
-   **Image Sliders/Carousels (SwiperJS):**
    -   Ensure smooth transitions and touch-friendly controls for mobile devices.
    -   Optimize images within sliders for fast loading.
-   **Galleries (`.gallery-grid`):**
    -   Consider hover effects on gallery items for visual feedback (e.g., slight zoom, shadow).
    -   "MORE" buttons should have clear destinations.
-   **Contact Form (`.contact-form`):**
    -   Provide clear visual feedback during form validation (e.g., highlighting errors, success messages).
    -   Ensure the `validateForm(event)` function is robust.
    -   Clarify form submission mechanism (e.g., if it will use a static form handler like Formspree or Netlify Forms, as there's no backend).
-   **Navigation & Links:**
    -   Hover states on all clickable links and buttons.
    -   Smooth scrolling for on-page links if any are used.
-   **(Future) Interactive Product Showcase:**
    -   If "MORE" leads to product details, consider interactive elements like image zoom on product photos, or tabbed content for specifications/details.

-   **Responsive:** Seamless experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
-   **Engaging:** Interactive elements should be subtle yet effective in drawing user attention and encouraging exploration.
